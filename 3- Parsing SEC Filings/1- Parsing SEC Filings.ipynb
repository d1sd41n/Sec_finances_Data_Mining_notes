    "# Parsing SEC Documents - New Filings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "In this notebook, we will go over how to parse SEC filing documents so you can extract different content from it and also logically organize the information. Making additional parsing more natural.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, it's safe to say that there is a remarkable amount of data available to individuals who seek high-quality financial data across a multitude of companies. This data can be used in a range of activities, from competition analysis to sentiment analysis. All it requires the individual to do is define a company they want, filing that belongs to that company, and the file that contains the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, we've defined a few ways to search for information depending on the type of search you want to conduct:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Broad Search:**\n",
    "You don't care what is returned, and you want all the filings for a given period. This search is best acheived by parsing the different index directories. These directories list all the filings made for a given period. While probably the most simple to wrap your head around, this returned the most significant amount of data. Making data management a priority.\n",
    "2. **Company Specific Search:**\n",
    "You are looking for a specific company and all their filings. There are currently two ways of doing this, using the CIK method or EDGAR Search Method. If you used the CIK method, you followed a technique that was similar to the Broad search method. Instead of looking at a specific period, you provide the CIK number, which will take you to a directory that contains all the filings that the company has made. Inside each filing folder, you would find all the files for that particular filing. If you didn't know the CIK number, you looked it up and did the CIK method. If you didn't know the CIK number you leveraged the EDGAR Search Method. Using this strategy meant requesting a URL that would direct you to a table containing all the filings for that company. However, this method required us to make a more complex script that would parse XML strings, paginating if the company had multiple pages, and reconstructing links to other directories.\n",
    "3. **Filing Specific Search:**\n",
    "Here you want only a specific filing for a particular company. Again this can be achieved either using the CIK Search Method or the EDGAR Search Method. It solely depends on whether you have the information upfront or not. The only additional piece of information you needed was the accession number.\n",
    "4. **Criteria Specific Search:**\n",
    "Here you were looking for a filing that has specific criteria, like the form being a 10K, a particular SIC number, or a particular date. This could only be achieved using the EDGAR Search Method, where you built a URL that contains the criteria you were searching on. In this case, your search was relatively simple because you only provided one rule. This search returns either an HTML or XML version of the data, which you would then have to parse.\n",
    "5. **Multi-Criteria Search:**\n",
    "This is similar to a form specific search, but instead of only having one criterion, you were searching on multiple criteria. The only difference here is you had to build and request a URL that contained multiple parameters. Once you got the data, it was parsed the same.\n",
    "6. **Text Search:**\n",
    "This type of search was done if you wanted to search on information found in the HEADER file for each filing. This allowed us to do the most complex searches as we could use boolean operators, wildcards, stemming, the order of evaluation, and phrase searching. While a powerful tool that allowed your searches to become very customized, it did require a decent working knowledge of both the HEADER file and search functionality. This was challenging as documentation is limited, requiring a fair amount of experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of your particular search method, each can give you access to filings that match the criteria you specified. Once you've landed on the filing, you want to scrape. You can begin the process of extracting the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries\n",
    "Surprisingly, we don't need that many libraries to scrape the SEC filing. In this particular tutorial, we will use the following libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. BeautifulSoup - This will be used to parse the actual text file content.\n",
    "2. Requests - This will be used to request the text file from the URL provided.\n",
    "3. Unicodedata - The text that is sent back is messy and will need to be cleaned up. We can use unicodedata to do that.\n",
    "4. Re - This is the RegEx library for python and will make looking for keywords smooth and quick.\n",
    "Depending on your specific needs, you may need extra libraries but at this point, for simplicity, we will keep it to these four."

    "The text is a mess, so we will need to normalize it. However, we can't rely on just the unicodedata library to help us. Some windows_1252_characters will provide some challenges. I found a solution on Stack Overflow that'll help us normalize the remaining portions of the data. All this function does is take a string, finds any qualifying matches, decodes those matches, and then replaces them in the string. In essence, it's just cleaning up the characters that weren't decoded by the unicodedata library."

I take the URL, request the content using a GET request, store the response in a variable called response, and then pass through the content into our BeautifulSoup parser object. Make sure to specify the lxml parser.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Old Vs. New\n",
    "This is an excellent time to mention document structure and how structure changes depending on the filing's age. In newer filings, the HTML code is very well structured, meaning the tags are correct and allow us to go into extraordinary detail when we parse the info. In older filings, the HTML code is not well strucutred. To give you an idea of what you'll encounter, entire content will b stored in tags called <PAGE> and tables that don't have normal td and tr elements. This is just listing a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the scraping strategy we leverage will depend on the age of the filing. Additionally, I can't say with confidence at what point in time a filing is considered \"old\" as I haven't explored enough filings to find a pattern. I'm assuming most of us don't need to go far back in time to collect data, so this series focuses on the \"newer\" filings. In other words, those filings that have will define HTML code inside the text file.\n",

    "Okay, so at this point, we are in pretty good shape. We have all the documents, they've been split into their pages and have been stored in the dictionary. From here, we can proceed to further data cleaning and transformation. Now, I will add a little bit of a disclosure. Technically, we could have done some of this cleaning up above, but for organizational purposes, I decided to loop through everything again and parse it that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would increase the amount of time it will take to run your code, but it is easier to follow. I will provide a more \"optimized\" script that will do the cleaning up above and store that on GitHub. Another drawback to this method is that I pass through all the code for each page back through BeautifulSoup. The reason why is the tags have been slightly messed up during the extraction and have to be fixed. I haven't run into many hiccups with this, but there is no guarantee that this will be the case for every filing type.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be asking why I am doing this method if there are these drawbacks. Well, I find I have a little bit more control over the process when it comes to leveraging patterns in the HTML code. These patterns will help us to find section headers, titles, and other \"meaningful\" components of the page that will provide context as to what it contains. This will serve to be useful down the road when we want to look for particular parts of a paragraph."

    "## Additional Scraping and Context Extraction\n",
    "Alright, so now we are really in a good spot. From here on out, most of what we need to do will be relatively straight forward. By maintaining the natural hierarchy of the filing, and only expanding upon it when beneficial, we can now easily do further analysis of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I'll demonstrate next is how to get different parts of each page. Additionally, I'll show you strategies for helping to infer the \"context\" of each page. For example, is a page a signature page, an exhibit page, or a section page? This will help give you context and help you get to where you need to be when getting info.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I'll demonstrate a strategy for how to search for keywords on each page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, like I mentioned up above, this might not be the fastest way to do it, but I am trying to layout this information in a logical format that flows from section to section. I am not concerned about the speed at this point; I'm worried about you following the steps I'm doing to clean my data. I will be posting a more \"optimized\" script on GitHub in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining Search Words\n",
    "Part of the next section is helping you gain a contextual understanding of each page/document. For example, you might have the belief that certain words like liability are only found in pages that talk about debt. If that is the case, then we can define a list of words and see if they are found on any of the pages of our document. If they are, we can store the matches in our master dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "With some background, let's define some words we might want to search for. Also, these are just guesses, and there is no guarantee that they will be the words we want. Unfortunately, you might have to read a few documents to determine the words that most appear in certain parts of the document."

    "Alright at this point you understand the natural hierarchy of an SEC filing, can parse an SEC filing for it's different documents, can break those documents into pages, can normalize the text of each page, can conduct searches on those pages, can create dictionaries that follow that natural hierarchy, can parse HTML tables, and can build custom search functions.\n",

    "If that sounds like a lot, it's because it is. There was a lot to this series, and it's just scratching the surface. I've seen individuals take this approach and expand on it to do a wide variety of tasks. However, what I hope this provides you is a foundation to build off of. The challenging thing about parsing documents is it's easy to get lost early on. My advice to you is to keep it simple, keep it organized, and keep it clean. Most importantly, keep it organized!\n",

    "The easiest way to take a simple problem and make it a complex problem is not to keep the task organized. You might also be wondering where do you go from here. The simple answer is it's up to you, and it depends on what you're doing. In some cases, it might make sense to take your numeric data and some of your text data and store it in a database. In other cases, you might want to dump your results in a text file.\n",
